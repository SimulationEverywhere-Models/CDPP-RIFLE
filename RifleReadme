Assault Rifle
=====================

The Assault Rifle has been developed and tested on a Win XP platform only. The
development environment was CD++ Toolkit, Version 3.3 for Eclipse. The CD++
Builder Plugin for Eclipse was Version 1.1.0.

Step 1:
	Download the Rifle.zip file and save to a convenient location.

Step 2:
	Within Eclipse (with CD++ Builder Plugin), create a new CD++ Project.

Step 3:
	Select "Import" from the file menu, and navigate to the Rifle.zip file.
	Select it, and select all the files in the archive to import.

Step 4:
	There are source files (.cpp and .h) as well as other files supporting the
	testing of the components (.ma .ev .bat and sample .log files), and finally
	files for the overall model. If these are extracted under a sub-folder,
	select them all and drag them to your Project root folder. The following files will
	be extracted:
	
		BoltAssy.h
		BoltAssy.cpp
		BoltAssy.ev
		BoltAssyMA.ma
		BoltAssyLOG.log
		BoltAssy.bat
		
		Bullet.h
		Bullet.cpp
		Bullet.ev
		BulletMA.ma
		BulletLOG.log
		Bullet.bat
		
		Chamber.h
		Chamber.cpp
		Chamber.ev
		ChamberMA.ma
		ChamberLOG.log
		Chamber.bat
		
		MagAssy.ev
		MagAssyMA.ma
		MagAssyLOG.log
		MagAssy.bat
		
		Magazine.h
		Magazine.cpp
		Magazine.ev
		MagazineMA.ma
		MagazineLOG.log
		Magazine.bat
		
		Rifle.ev
		RifleMA.ma
		RifleLOG.log
		Rifle.bat
	
		RifleReadme (this file - instructions)
		Rifle.doc (Model report, Word .doc format)
		Rifle.pdf (Model report, pretty Postscript document format .pdf)
		register.cpp
		
		TrigAssy.h
		TrigAssy.cpp
		TrigAssy.ev
		TrigAssyMA.ma
		TrigAssyLOG.log
		TrigAssy.bat
		

Step 5:  
	Now its time to compile the Rifle model. Click on one of the files, and click on the "Build" button.

Step 6:
	Each of the atomic models can tested using the attached ".bat" files, appropriately named.
	To test the full Rifle model, run "Rifle.bat". ENJOY!
